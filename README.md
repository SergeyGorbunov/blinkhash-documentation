Introduction
----

This repository contains the current documentation for the Blinkhash Mining Pools's backend REST API (v1). The API itself is relatively simple. Each of its endpoints were designed to be self-explanatory while still providing users with standardized JSON-formatted responses, making it easy to search, filter and use our data. The base URL for all requests is https://www.blinkhash.com/api/v1. The complete URL varies depending on the endpoint of the resource being accessed. For instance, you can view the statistics for each of our supported pools via a GET request to this URL: https://www.blinkhash.com/api/v1/statistics.
